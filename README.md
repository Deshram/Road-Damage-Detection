# Road-Damage-Detection

Detecting different types of damages of roads like cracks and potholes for the given image/video of the road.</br>

Dataset: https://github.com/sekilab/RoadDamageDetector</br>
It consist of images of roads of different countries (Japan, India, Czech). Majority of them was from japan.</br>
With image files it also contain the label information of each image in pascval voc format.

Tried different [models](https://github.com/Deshram/Road-Damage-Detection/tree/main/models) like ssd_mobilenet, efficientdet and yolo.</br>

As the yolo model gave good results made a demo [web_app](https://github.com/Deshram/Road-Damage-Detection/tree/main/web_app) for localhost with that model.
